# Key Deliverables & Fixes:

1.  **Main Menu Restoration**: Fixed the "Start Game" button responsiveness. The menu now correctly transitions through the `Initializing` state into `InGame`. Added `Button` and `Interaction` logic compatible with Bevy 0.18.
2.  **Atomic Action: Link**: Implemented the `AtomicAction::Link` logic in action_system.rs. This allows actors to physically attach entities (e.g., picking up a tool) via Bevy's parent-child system.
3.  **Tool-Amplified Force**: Refactored `ApplyForce` calculation. Actors now check their children (linked entities) for `MaterialProperties`. 
    *   **Formula**: `Effective Force = Base Force + (Tool Hardness * 0.5) + (Tool Mass * 0.1)`. 
    *   This makes a unit holding a "Stone" (Hardness 8.0) significantly more effective at breaking obstacles than one using bare hands.
4.  **Emergent Tool Gathering**: Updated thinking_system.rs with a new motivation. If an actor doesn't have a tool, they will now search for nearby items with high `hardness` but low `energy_density` (like Stones or Logs), move to them, and execute a `Link` action.
5.  **Data-Driven Decoupling**: 
    *   Moved passability logic entirely into `MaterialProperties` via `is_obstacle()`.
    *   Identity enums like `ItemType` are now strictly for visual lookups.
    *   Updated `TileType` and unit spawning to use these physical properties.
6.  **Evolutionary Engine**: Finalized reproduction_system.rs with **Genetic Drift**. When a unit reproduces (at 80% energy), its child inherits its `Genome` (Hunger weights, Size, Fatigue sensitivity) with random mutations, allowing for natural selection to occur over generations.
7.  **ECS Stability**: Resolved the critical `B0001` aliasing panic in the `action_processor_system` by splitting queries for actors and targets, ensuring safe mutable access during complex interactions.

### Verification of Progress
*   [x] **Phase 1: Cleanup**: `ItemType` is now a visual preset; physical logic is property-driven.
*   [x] **Phase 2: Link & Force**: Emergent tool usage loop is fully implemented.
*   [x] **Phase 3: Genetics**: Reproduction system is active and consistently uses the physical model.
*   [x] **Bug Fix**: Main Menu is fully functional.
